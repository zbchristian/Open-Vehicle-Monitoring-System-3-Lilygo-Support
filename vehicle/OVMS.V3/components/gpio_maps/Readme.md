GPIO Definitions for alternative OVMS Hardware
==============================================
The default GPIO assignments are defined in `ovm_peripherals.h`.
By switching to an alternative GPIO mapping via `make menuconfig -> Component config -> Open Vehicle Monitoring System -> Hardware Support -> Choose GPIO Mapping`, non default hardware can utilize the OVMS firmware.

Requirements
------------
- the hardware components are compatible with the default OVMS module, e.g. ESP32, Simcom modem, ESP32Can and MCP2515 based CAN bus
- the names of the pins are consistent with the firmware (see below for details)
- all hardware components need to be selected via `make menuconfig`

Comments:
- The RS pin of the CAN transceiver SN65HVD233 or similar, allows to switch between a listen only mode (high level) and standard mode (low level)
- The RS pin is only directly connected to a GPIO for the built-in ESP32CAN bus.
- The RS pin of the other CAN buses is driven by the IO pins of the MCP2515 CAN bus controller (via SPI commands)
- All names containing `MAX7317` or `EGPIO` are only required, if the GPIO extender chip MAX7317 is present and activated via `menuconfig` 
- The modem power pin: Simcom recommends to utilize an open collector driver (NPN transistor) for the PWR pin. This is present in the default OVMS module. The logic is therefore inverted in the Simcom modem drivers. 

How to create a GPIO Mapping file
---------------------------------
- Create a file in `components/gpio_maps` e.g `mygpios.h`
- Assign the GPIO pins to the corresponding name via `#define` statements. 
- Enter the new file name via `menuconfig` as the GPIO map. If a different directory is chosen for the location of the map, the full path has to be specified.

Example snippet
---------------

````
#define VSPI_PIN_MISO             19
#define VSPI_PIN_MOSI             23
#define VSPI_PIN_CLK              18

````

Be aware, that the numbers are the GPIO numbers and NOT the ESP32 pin numbers.

In case the GPIO extender chip MAX7317 is not present in the hardware, the support has to be disabled via `menuconfig` and the no assignment to the corresponding names is required.
